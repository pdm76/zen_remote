# Example workflow

1. **git status** – Make sure your current area is clean.
2. **git pull** – Get the latest version from the remote. This saves merging issues later.
3. **Edit your files and make your changes**. Remember to run your linter and do unit tests!
4. **git status** – Find all files that are changed. Make sure to watch untracked files too!
5. **git add [files]** – Add the changed files to the staging area.
6. **git commit -m "message"** – Make your new commit.
7. **git push origin [branch-name]** – Push your changes up to the remote.
